# ARTiiFACT - A tool for heart rate artifact processing and heart rate variability analysis.

```diff
! After we shared ARTiiFACT for >8 years via www.artiifact.de, we closed artiifact.de
! After 10 years of active user support, we do no longer provide an active support.
+ ARTiiFACT can now be downloaded from this github repository free of charge.
! ARTiiFACT is provided as-is, without warranty or support.
```

## Features

ARTiiFACT's main features are:
- Extraction of interbeat intervals (IBI) from electrocardiogram (ECG) data, both automated and manual
- Artifact processing in IBI data, both automated and manual
- Computation of heart rate variability (HRV) in time and frequency domain
- Statistical analysis of distribution criteria

## Corresponding publication

An article explaining all features, implementation details and validation of software was published in Behavior Research Methods:

## License

**ARTiiFACT is provided free of charge to the research community.**

The software was developed in Matlab, yet no Matlab license is required. 


## Warranty and support

**NB! ARTiiFACT is provided "as-is" and comes without warranty of any kind.** After 10 years of user support, we have now closed the support.
